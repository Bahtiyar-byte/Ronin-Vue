        working hours, and Customer agrees to provide Company access to Customer’s property as required for completion of the work. Customer
        will be responsible if any interruption of Company’s work results from Customer’s failure to provide reasonable access or due to the acts or
        negligence of others not under Company’s direction. Company shall not be responsible for damages arising from delay due to inclement
        weather, strikes, fires, accidents, delays in shipments or delivery of materials, or any causes beyond Company’s reasonable control. Customer

        Customer’s acceptance thereof) or the date of Company’s last item of work at the property, whichever is earlier. Customer’s failure to make
        prompt payment shall entitle Company, on forty-eight (48) hours’ written notice, to stop work. The Agreed Price shall be increased by
        Company’s reasonable costs to stop the project and/or resume work. In the event Customer chooses not to pay for a part of the work, an

        price increases. Customer agrees to allow these supplements to be paid directly to Company. Company makes no representations or
        warranties regarding Customer’s insurance coverage or if Customer’s insurer will pay for all or any of the work to be performed by Company
        under this Agreement. Customer agrees to pay Company in full for all work performed by Company under this Agreement, regardless of
        Customer’s insurance coverage. Customer also agrees to pay Company directly for all amounts, despite depreciation or deductibles, and to
        also pay for additional work not covered by Customer’s insurer and that said amounts must be paid before job completion. Company and its
        authorized representatives are NOT acting as public adjusters.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="underline">Damages</span>. If Customer’s insurance company approves the work set forth herein and Customer fails to authorize and/or grant access to
        Company to commence such work, then Customer shall pay Company 20% of the replacement cost value of the insurance claim (the
